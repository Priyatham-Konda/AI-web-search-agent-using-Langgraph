# LangGraph LLM Architecture Patterns

## Overview

There are three main patterns for organizing LLMs in LangGraph applications:

## 1. Centralized LLM (ReAct Agent) - **RECOMMENDED**

### Pros:
- **Most LangGraph-native**: Uses built-in `create_react_agent`
- **Minimal code**: LangGraph handles tool calling, reasoning, and flow
- **Automatic tool integration**: Built-in tool calling and execution
- **Battle-tested**: Uses proven ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern
- **Best performance**: Optimized by LangGraph team
- **Easier debugging**: Single LLM interaction point

### Cons:
- **Less granular control**: Harder to customize individual steps
- **Black box reasoning**: Less visibility into decision process
- **Tool calling dependency**: Requires LLM with good tool calling support

### Best for:
- Production applications
- Standard Q&A with tools
- When you want minimal maintenance
- Teams new to LangGraph

```python
# Simple and powerful
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, system_message="...")
result = agent.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="question")]})
```

## 2. Hybrid Approach

### Pros:
- **Balanced control**: Custom nodes with centralized LLM
- **Flexible**: Can add custom logic while using LangGraph patterns
- **Maintainable**: Single LLM instance, multiple usage points
- **Debuggable**: More visibility than pure ReAct

### Cons:
- **More complex**: Requires more setup than ReAct
- **Potential inconsistency**: Multiple LLM calls might behave differently
- **Manual tool integration**: Need to handle tool calling logic

### Best for:
- Applications needing custom workflow steps
- When you need some control but want centralized LLM
- Complex business logic requirements

## 3. Distributed LLM (Current Approach)

### Pros:
- **Maximum control**: Each node can have specialized prompts
- **Specialized behavior**: Different temperature/settings per task
- **Clear separation**: Each step is explicit and debuggable
- **Educational**: Great for understanding each component

### Cons:
- **More code**: Requires LLM initialization in each node
- **Higher latency**: Multiple LLM calls increase response time
- **Higher costs**: More API calls = more expensive
- **Maintenance overhead**: More code to maintain and debug
- **Potential inconsistency**: Different LLM instances might behave differently

### Best for:
- Learning and experimentation
- Applications with very different requirements per step
- When you need maximum customization

## Performance Comparison

| Pattern | API Calls | Latency | Cost | Complexity | Maintainability |
|---------|-----------|---------|------|------------|-----------------|
| Centralized (ReAct) | 1-3 | Low | Low | Low | High |
| Hybrid | 2-4 | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Distributed | 5-7 | High | High | High | Low |

## Recommendation

**Use the Centralized LLM (ReAct Agent) approach** for most applications because:

1. **It's the LangGraph way**: Built-in functions are optimized and maintained
2. **Better performance**: Fewer API calls, lower latency
3. **Lower costs**: Minimal LLM usage
4. **Easier to maintain**: Less custom code
5. **Production ready**: Battle-tested by the community

## Migration Path

If you want to migrate from distributed to centralized:

1. **Start with ReAct agent**: Replace the entire workflow with `create_react_agent`
2. **Add custom nodes if needed**: Only for business logic that can't be handled by tools
3. **Use tools for external operations**: Web search, calculations, database queries
4. **Keep state minimal**: Let LangGraph handle most of the complexity

## Example Use Cases

### Centralized LLM (ReAct):
- Customer support chatbots
- Research assistants
- General Q&A systems
- Document analysis with tools

### Hybrid:
- Multi-step workflows with approval gates
- Applications with complex business rules
- Systems requiring audit trails

### Distributed:
- Educational/learning projects
- Highly specialized domain applications
- Research and experimentation
